# rva-tree-inventory

Richmond, Virginia has a great tree inventory (a few years old) which [you can view online here](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3dda2aa7521941d8a48dc91f5014a5c8).

I wanted to be able to play around with the data myself, so I scraped it from the ArcGIS API. 

 * The data is saved in tree_inventory_[date].csv
 * The visualization code is in visualize.ipynb
 * The scraper code is in tree_inventory_parse.ipynb
 * There's some samples in /pics/

You can run `pip install requirements.txt` to install the packages, I think I got them all.
